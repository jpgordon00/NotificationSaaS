# REST-based Notification System

This project was a self-conducted exploration into creating a REST-based notification system for clients. The purpose of the project was to gain experience in developing microservices and associated infrastructure-as-code (IAC) for a variety of purposes. This project involved writing code for the notification service, setting up the associated infrastructure, and ensuring all components worked together correctly.

The notification system was written using Express and Node.JS and was designed around the REST principles. It allowed users to push notifications, poll notifications, set notifications as seen or unseen, and query notifications. All notifications were stored in an AWS DynamoDB table, while associated files were stored in an AWS S3 bucket.

The project provided me with an opportunity to explore many facets of developing a service-oriented architecture. I was able to familiarize myself with developing and deploying microservices, setting up associated infrastructure, and creating unit tests for the services.

## What I Learned

This project was a great learning experience for me, as I was able to explore a range of topics related to service-oriented architecture development. I was able to gain a greater understanding of REST principles and how they apply to developing services, as well as experience in setting up AWS services such as DynamoDB and S3. Additionally, I was able to gain experience in writing unit tests for the services, ensuring that all components worked together correctly. Overall, I was able to gain a greater appreciation for the complexity of developing a service-oriented architecture.
